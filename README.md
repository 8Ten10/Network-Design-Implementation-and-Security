# Network Design, Implementation and Security

![Network_diagram](images/attempt_Final.png)

This Lab is about implementing an on-premise computer network infrastructure for a business. From designing the network, deploying the hardwares, to deploying and configuring the servers and the workstations.

This is a completly virtualized environment so everything will run through an hypervisor. I went with a type 2, VMware Workstation. This can also be archieved with a type 1 hypervisor but you will need a dedicated station. 

The top layer diagram above show what my physical workstation looks like and the bottom layer what to expect from this lab. 

I will link a video for each part of this lab.

Before getting started, make sure you download and gather all the files (ISO, softwares...) you will need for this lab into one folder on your host computer. Later on, you will enable `Folder Sharing` in Vmware workstation pointing to that folder. Then set up a file server pointing to that folder to make your deployments easier.


### Installing VMware workstation

Installing Development tools and Kernel Headers

```console
sudo dnf upgrade -y
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development tools"  
apt install build-essential #Run this command only if you are running a debian base distribution
```

```console
wget https://download3.vmware.com/software/WKST-1700-LX/VMware-Workstation-Full-17.0.0-20800274.x86_64.bundle 
sudo chmod +x VMware-Workstation-Full-17.0.0-20800274.x86_64.bundle
sudo ./VMware-Workstation-Full-17.0.0-20800274.x86_64.bundle

```
The set of commands above will download the latest VMware Workstation, make it executable and install it. Next just run `vmware` either from the terminal or from your installed sofwares. Follow the instructions and you should be good to go.


### Deploying the the Hardware

Configuriging Virtual Network Editors

There is no physical hardware involved in this lab, so you will need to comfigure WMware Workstation's Virtual Network Editor to simulate Physical Network interfaces. We will need 4 for this lab. The first network interface, `vmnet8` will simulated your WAN network. It does not matter what type (bridged or NAT) you choose. I personnaly went with NAT mode. The remaining 3 interfaces (vmnet10, vmnet11, vmnet12), that we will create, will simulate our LAN networks. So they have to be completely isolated. They will, hence, be configured in `Host-only` mode.

In linux you can edit vmware's networking file with

```console
sudo vi /etc/vmware/networking

```

Add the following line 
```
answer VNET_10_DISPLAY_NAME
answer VNET_10_HOSTONLY_NETMASK 255.0.0.0
answer VNET_10_HOSTONLY_SUBNET 10.0.0.0
answer VNET_10_MTU 1500
answer VNET_10_VIRTUAL_ADAPTER yes
answer VNET_11_DHCP no
answer VNET_11_DISPLAY_NAME
answer VNET_11_HOSTONLY_NETMASK 255.255.0.0
answer VNET_11_HOSTONLY_SUBNET 172.16.0.0
answer VNET_11_MTU 1500
answer VNET_11_VIRTUAL_ADAPTER yes
answer VNET_12_DHCP no
answer VNET_12_DISPLAY_NAME
answer VNET_12_HOSTONLY_NETMASK 255.255.255.0
answer VNET_12_HOSTONLY_SUBNET 192.168.1.0
answer VNET_12_MTU 1500
answer VNET_12_VIRTUAL_ADAPTER yes
```

Then do 
```console
sudo vmware-networks â€“start
``

Of course that configuration can also be done using the GUI. Just open VMware Workstation and go to Edit => Virtual Network Editor

Make sure, though, that DHCP is turned off on your LAN Networks. This will be handled later on by the router.

###Deploying The router, Pfsense

Now, with the Virtual Interfaces created and configured, the next step should logically be to deploy the heart of our network system, the router.
